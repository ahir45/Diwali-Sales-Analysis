#Diwali Sales Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing sales data during the Diwali festival period. The dataset used in this analysis is stored in the 'Diwali Sales Data.csv' file. The project leverages Python programming along with key libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

#Project Structure
data/: This directory contains the dataset file 'Diwali Sales Data.csv'.
notebooks/: This directory includes Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration and analysis.
visualizations/: This directory contains visualizations generated during the analysis.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.
Analysis Steps
Data Loading: The dataset is imported using pandas, and the shape, summary statistics, and data types of the dataset are examined.
Data Preprocessing: Unrelated/blank columns are dropped, and null values are handled by either dropping the rows or imputing values.
Data Transformation: The 'Amount' column is converted to integer data type for further analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is performed to gain insights into the data using visualizations and statistical analysis.
Gender Analysis: Bar charts are created to visualize the count of customers and total sales amount by gender.
Age Analysis: Bar charts are generated to analyze the customer count and total sales amount by age group.
State Analysis: Bar charts are used to explore the number of orders and total sales amount in the top 10 states.
Marital Status Analysis: Bar charts are created to examine the customer count and total sales amount by marital status and gender.
Occupation Analysis: Bar charts are generated to analyze the customer count and total sales amount by occupation.
Product Category Analysis: Bar charts are used to explore the customer count and total sales amount by product category.
Top Products Analysis: Bar charts are created to visualize the top 10 most sold products based on the number of orders and total sales amount.
Please refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the 'notebooks/' directory for detailed code and analysis.

#Instructions
Ensure that Python, along with the required libraries (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), is installed.
Download the 'Diwali Sales Data.csv' dataset file and place it in the 'data/' directory.
Open the Jupyter notebooks in the 'notebooks/' directory to run the code and explore the analysis.
Review the visualizations generated in the 'visualizations/' directory for better understanding of the sales data during the Diwali festival period.
Feel free to explore and modify the code as per your requirements.
